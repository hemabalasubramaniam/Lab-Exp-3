                            Well, who does not love desserts? We all do! Of course, eating it every day is not going to be good for our bodies, but eating 
                it every once in a while will not hurt us.Desserts come in all shapes and sizes. There are candy, pies, ice creams, 
                sweet chocolate, and who knows what else. Moreover, these deserts can be vegan, raw, organic, and those old-fashioned caloric ones. 
                There is something for everybodyâ€™s taste, that is for sure. And what is more, they will never go out of style, either 
                those big complicated 5-layers cakes for special occasions or those simple dessert dips for every day. Again, you will find
                 millions of dessert food blogs online, so be extra careful when choosing a name for your blog: Here are some ideas:

                    Nowadays, fortunately, people really started to appreciate healthy foods. And you can see so many ealthy food blogs and <b>healthy meal ideas online.</b>
            That is both great and not so great. It is great because it means that people are really into these kinds of blogs and that your
            site is probably going to be popular. But, it is not that great, because the competition is huge and it is going to be hard to
            pick a name that does not exist already.
            However, it is nothing to be worried about.Just think about your favourite healthy meals or healthy ingredients.
            think of and coming up with the name for your food blog will be as easy as those easy healthy recipes. Here are some ideas:

                    A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may include little to no processed food 
                    or sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although a 
                    non-plant source of vitamin B12 is needed for those following a vegan diet. Various nutrition guides are published by medical and 
                    governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory 
                    in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.

                            Whole grain foods are any foods that contain every part of the grain, including the outer layers,
                    bran and germ. Processed, white grains have the bran removed which is where many of the nutrients are stored;
                    they therefore, end up having less nutritional value than whole grains. It is possible to purchase fortified grains 
                    and cereals in which the lost nutrients have been replaced by the manufacturer. 
                    However, wholegrain foods are still the best option.Any food made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley,
                    or another cereal grain is a grain product. Bread, pasta, breakfast cereals, grits, and tortillas are examples of grain products. 
                    Foods such as popcorn, rice, and oatmeal are also included in the Grains Group.
